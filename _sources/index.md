# Welcome to the Image Generation Technology Learning Book

This book aims to help you understand image generation technology, including Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)„ÄÅVariational Autoencoder and Stable Diffusion Models. Through this book, you will learn about the necessary background knowledge, different types of image generation models, and some practical assignments to help you master the field.

## Prerequisite Knowledge

Before diving into image generation technology, we will provide you with some necessary prerequisite python knowledge to help you better understand the subsequent learning content.

## Image Generation Models

This website will introduce different types of image generation models, including Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), etc. You will learn about the principles, application scenarios, and implementation methods of these models.

## Assignments

To help you consolidate your knowledge, we have prepared some practical assignments. Through these assignments, you will have the opportunity to implement image generation models and apply them to real-world problems.

We hope this book can be a good starting point for your study of image generation technology, helping you explore the field more deeply. Happy learning!
